### Goal (may expand): Stuyvesant Buying and Selling website, add more features so we aren't stuck using a facebook group and hopefully it won't die after a few weeks.
To create a chrome web extension that notifies the user of any updates to a site.

### Plans:
#### Site changes based on:
- number of total tags
- number of a <i>certain tag</i>
- new tag added or deleted

#### Save site to a local destination for comparision?

#### Resources to use:
- Node.js web scrapes
