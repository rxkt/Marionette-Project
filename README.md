### Goal (may expand): Stuyvesant Buying and Selling website, add more features so we aren't stuck using a facebook group and hopefully it won't die after a few weeks.

### Plans:
####JS-> Firebase (as our database): (login system, products)
####CSS, buying-selling system structure
####D3-SVG visual on product reviews, user reviews.

###Timeline
4/29 : Created Basic Login, tried firebase to store information
4/30 : Libraries, moved to flask and created more html pages
5/3 : Attempted to use Socket to tie js and python
5/5 : Continued to debug Socket, tried to make variables clearer
5/8 : Socket successfully works, added session, started design/css of html pages.
5/11 : Moved to MongoDB? maybe. Framework practically complete.

5/15 - 5/17 : Finish css/design of pages. Make everything look good.
5/17 : Begin adding the extra features behind the design, such as buying/selling , stats of the user , location (seller/buyer wants to meet) , items user has bid on / is selling , etc.
5/22 : Finish an auction system? Use d3 to make graphs from statistics.
5/24 : Probably add a feature to upload a picture of the product. Anything extra , maybe a chat system in spare time.
